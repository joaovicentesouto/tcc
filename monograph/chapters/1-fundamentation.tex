\section{Operating Systems Concepts}
    This section may come sooner (here).

\section{Multiple Processor Systems}

    In this section, I will show severals concepts about Multiple Processor Systems.
    
    (Tanenbaum overview is completed.)

    Von Neumann Model -> Main Systems Organization

\subsection{Multiprocessors}
    Hardware overview.
    - Flynn's Organization.
    - Maybe speak UMA and NUMA.
    
    Software overview.
    - OS
    - Processor, thread (simiraly with Flynn Organization)


\subsection{Multicomputers}
    Hardware overview.
    Software overview.

    Important: Low-level Software and User-level Software primarily for communication.

\subsection{Manycores}
    Focus on manycores.

    Use the above concepts to build the narrative on manycores.

\subsubsection{MPPA-256}
    Focus on manycores.

\section{Multikernel OS Concept}
    In this section, I will write about the Multikernel OS concept using Nanvix has an example.

\section{Microkernel OS Concept}
    Focus on microkernel.

\section{Nanvix HAL}
    Focus on HAL.
