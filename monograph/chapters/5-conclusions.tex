	Figure \ref{chart.gantt} shows the planned activities and their durations visually.
	Beginning in July 2019, the final submission is planned for December 2019.
	In detail, the activities are described below:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Writing the Implementation and Experiments:}
			Currently, the inter-cluster communication module has the \sync abstraction
			completed and part of the \mailbox abstraction.
			Since the \portal abstraction uses the same low-level mechanisms of the others
			abstractions, its implementation will be facilitated.
			The communication services already have prototypes developed by the author
			for a symmetric \os.
			In this way, the prototypes will need to be modified to use the \hal and
			modified for a master-slave model.
			Finally, micro-benchmarks will be developed to perform an analysis of the
			performance of the implemented services.
		\item \textbf{In-depth Writing of the Proposal:}
			During September and October, this activity will be committed to improving
			this draft and detailing the project decisions chose and implementations produced.
			We will also describe the experiments performed and discuss the results obtained.
		\item \textbf{Presentation of the Undergraduate Dissertation:}
			November will be dedicated to the development and preparation of the presentation
			of the work and the results achieved.
			So finally, to present the dissertation to the evaluators.
		\item \textbf{Review and Final Submission of the Undergraduate Dissertation:}
			Finally, December will be dedicated to the correction of the issues indicated
			by the evaluators and finalized with the final submission of the dissertation.
