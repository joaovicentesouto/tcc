% Context
% Historical background
% Frequency barrier
	For some years, it was common to increase the frequency of processors
	to improve their processing power.
	However, as a side effect, the temperature rise was much higher than the
	performance, making this practice prohibitive.
	Alternatively, the constant improvement of semiconductor technology helped
	to mitigate the impact of this problem, allowing the industry to build
	more powerful processors with the same frequency.
	Therefore, knowing the frequency barrier and the imminent end of Moore's Law~\cite{moore:1965},
	the academy and industry began to research and invest in alternatives
	to keep increasing the processing power of computer systems.

% Improves architectural parts
	Such researches have led to a wide diversity of trade-offs in modern architectures.
	For instance, different types of instruction sets, instruction parallelism,
	out-of-order processing techniques, detour prediction techniques, and various
	memory hierarchies were some of the key techniques proposed to improve the
	performance of a single core.
	Then, the performance of computer systems has been improved even further by
	increasing the number of processing cores in a single die.
	These architectures, called \textit{multicores}, allowed the continuous
	rise of the computing performance.

% - Original {
	In some point, with reduction of transistors and the number of cores inside
	a multiprocessor began to scale, these architectures must be called \manycores.
	Notwithstanding, the line between \textit{multicores} and \manycores is very tenuous.
	Some researchers stipulate that the difference lies when losing a core
	does not impact the rest of the system.

% From multicore to manycores
	However, Figure \ref{fig.microprocessor-data} illustrates that, in recent years,
	the energy consumption of parallel processors has become as crucial as their
	processing power, which is usually measured by the number of \flops.
	At this point, with the popularization of embedded systems as well as the aim
	to reach the \exascale (10$^{18}$ \flops), a new class of parallel processors,
	named \textit{lightweight} \manycores, emerged to provide high parallelism
	with low-power consumption.

% Manycores characteristics
	The main characteristics of \textit{lightweight} \manycores are the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item They integrate thousands of low-power cores in a single die organized in clusters;
		\item They are designed to cope with \mimd workloads;
		\item They rely on a high-bandwidth \noc for fast and reliable message-passing communication;
		\item They present constrained memory systems; and
		\item They frequently feature a heterogeneous configuration.
	\end{itemize}
	Some industry-successful examples of \textit{lightweight} \manycores are
	the \mppa~\cite{DeDinechin2013-1};
	the \epiphany~\cite{olofsson2014}; and
	the \taihulight~\cite{zheng2015}.

% Motivation
	Jointly with further performance scalability and energy efficiency, manycores brought a new
	set of challenges in software development coming from their architectural particularities.
	Precisely, these particularities introduce the following difficulties:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Hybrid programming model:} due to the parallel and distributed nature of
			the architecture, engineers are frequently required to adopt a message-passing
			programming model to deal with the presence of rich \nocs~\cite{kelly2013} that
			interconnects clusters and a shared-memory model inside the cluster.
		\item \textbf{Missing hardware support for cache coherency:} to reduce power consumption,
			theses processors do not feature cache coherency, which in turn forces programmers to
			handle it explicitly in software level and frequently calls out for a redesign in their
			applications~\cite{francesquini2015};
		\item \textbf{Constrained memory system:} the frequent presence of multiple physical
			address spaces and small local memories require data tiling and prefetching to be
			handled by the software~\cite{Castro2016};
		\item \textbf{Heterogeneous configuration:} the different programmable components on
			\textit{lightweight} \manycores turns the actual deployment of applications in a
			complex task~\cite{barbalace2015}.
	\end{itemize}

% Challenges and Problem Definition
	Part of these challenges derives from existing \oses and runtimes.
	On the one hand, the complicated portability and scalability of traditional \oses with a
	monolithic kernels, which were designed to homogeneous hardwares, is leading to alternative
	\os designs~\cite{Baumann2009, kluge2014, nightingale2009, rhoden2011}.
	On the other hand, existing runtimes only partially address some of the programmability issues
	of \textit{lightweight} \manycores, making the process of developing, porting, and maintaining
	applications a challenging task.

% Goals and Contributions
	We believe that \oses for the next-generation of \textit{lightweight} \manycores must be
	redesigned from scratch to cope with their tight architectural constraints.
	Based on this idea, a new fully-featured distributed \os based on a \multikernel approach~\cite{Baumann2009}
	is being proposed~\cite{penna2017-1,penna2017-2,penna2019}.
	The \nanvix \microkernel features a generic and flexible \hal for \textit{lightweight} \manycores that
	addresses the key issues encountered in the development for these processors.
	On top of the \nanvix \hal, we are simultaneously designing and implementing a \microkernel
	that provides bare bones system abstractions for each cluster.

\section{Goals}
\label{sec.goals}

	Based on the aforementioned motivations, the primary and specific goals of this work are detailed next.

\subsection{General Goals}
\label{sec.goals.general}

	The foremost goal of this undergraduate dissertation is to propose a \textit{Inter-Cluster Communication Module}
	to the \nanvix \hal and port it to the \mppa manycore processor~\cite{DeDinechin2013-1}.
	This module will expose the essential abstractions that permit upper layers to create more
	sophisticated communication services.
	Using this module, we also propose \textit{Inter-Cluster Communication Services} to the \nanvix \microkernel.
	This work will be done in collaboration with Pedro H. Penna, who is a Ph.D. student at the
	University of Grenoble Alpes, the main developer of Nanvix and the co-advisor of this work.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Propose interfaces to the Inter-Cluster Communication Module aiming
			the class of \textit{lightweight} \manycore processors.
		\item Implement the interfaces for the \textit{\mppa manycore processor}.
		\item Define Communication Services and their strategies in the use of the Inter-Cluster
			Communication Module in the context of a microkernel-based \os.
		\item Implement the Communication Services for the \nanvix Microkernel.
		\item Analyze the performance of the proposed implemen using specific micro-benchmarks.
