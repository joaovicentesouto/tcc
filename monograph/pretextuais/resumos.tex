Parcial.

Jointly with further performance scalability and energy efficiency, lightweight manycores
brought a new set of challenges in software development coming from their architectural
particularities. Part of these challenges derives from existing runtimes and \oses that
not completely handle extant intricacies.
In particular, due to the distributed nature of the manycores, communication abstractions
play a crucial role in the scalability and performance of these processors.
In this scenario, the goal of this work is to develop an inter-cluster communication module
for the emergent \mppa Lightweight Manycore Processor.
This module is part of a generic and flexible \hal for lightweight manycores that cope with
the key issues encountered in designing an \os for these processors.
On top of this module, communication services will also be proposed for a Microkernel \os
that seeks to provide bare bones for system abstractions.
